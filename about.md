I am Alexander Niki. IT specialyst, minimalist. My mission is to unclutter the world aroud me and make things clear again.

## About this site

As you can see, English is not my native language and you can find sone grammar errors.
I write in English because it is interesting for me and it is a good way to improve language skills. Some posts are in Russian because Russian is my native language.

This blog is a collection of my notes, links and reviews.

Sometimes you could see some notes written in Russian here.
