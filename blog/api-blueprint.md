# apiblueprint.org: a good thing for working with REST APIs

## Apiblueprint

Apiblueprint is a small markdown-based "language" for people who work with REST APIs.
By saying "language" I mean a specification and a set of rules intended for documatating REST APIs.

Using apiblueprint rules makes it really easy to read and write API documentation in a standard way. Looks like this:

```
# GET /message
+ Response 200 (text/plain)

        Hello World!
```

Take a look at it here: [apiblueprint.org](https://apiblueprint.org)
