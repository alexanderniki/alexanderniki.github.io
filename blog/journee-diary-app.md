# Journee - simple crossplatform journal/diary app


## Intro

Sometimes writing diaries could be very useful. Dumping thoughts, learning new languages, analyzing your own life or just jotting down daily things. That's where some kind of journal could be really handy.

I tried number of different tools and approaches.

These were:

- plain text files
- markdown files
- Zim with calendar plugin
- RedNotebook app

And finally I found Journee - very simple, yet nice tool. And I decided to give it a try.


## About the app

Journee is just a simple opensource journal/diary app.

It is written with Electron/JS and avalable for both Linux and Windows OSes.

Official website: [https://adueck.github.io/journee/](https://adueck.github.io/journee/)

Journee stores its data in plain text files in your filesystem. So you could easily sync it between computers with Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.


## Using Journee

Basically, the app consists of only one screen: plain text editor and calendar widget.

At the very first start, app will ask you where you want to store your data. Select anny folder and continue.

And that's all! Click on any day and start writing.

You'll find you diary entries in prevously selected folder. One for each day. The app names files like yyyy-mm-dd.txt.

Journee allows one to search in diary. Type a word and you'll see the results.

Good. Simple.

**Bad**:

- no autosave
- quite heavyweight ("thanks" to Electron)
- poor settings: only font size and storage folder

## Outro

Journee seems to be a good app. I definitely will give it a try.
